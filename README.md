# Concave Detector Bot

## Overview
The **Concave Detector Bot** is an autonomous robot designed to navigate environments while detecting concave surfaces. It uses ultrasonic sensors to measure distances and adjust movement accordingly. The robot employs motor-driven mobility with intelligent decision-making to maneuver around obstacles and respond to different surface types.

## Features
- Uses **ultrasonic sensors** for front and side distance measurement.
- Autonomous navigation with **obstacle avoidance**.
- **Concave surface detection** for improved path planning.
- Motor control for **forward, backward, and turning movements**.
- LED indicators for status signaling.
- Implemented using **Arduino and motor driver circuitry**.
